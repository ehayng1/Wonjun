1. Clone or fork project.
2. Install required dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Remove `homepage` entirely from `package.json` or set it to single dot. 

```
// package.json
{
  "name": "react-frontend-dev-portfolio",
  "homepage": "https://dorota1997.github.io/react-frontend-dev-portfolio/",   <-- remove/edit this
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
  ...
}
```

4. `npm start` project and customize it.
5. Deploy on github-pages using `npm run deploy` command.

<pre>
⚠️ Note that:
- if you want to have portfolio on different repository than `{username}.github.io`, 
set `homepage` in `package.json` to `https://{username}.github.io/{repository-name}/` 
before deploying portfolio.
- if you want to run it locally with <strong>npm run start</strong>, make sure that you have edited 
homepage property or json data won't load.
